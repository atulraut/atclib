/*Functions and Recursion & Pointers*/

1. Write a function to do given operation on the two operands specified. Operation may be '+', '-', '*', '/'.
Hint:- Prototype:- float operate(float oprd1, float oprd2, char oprn);

2. Input a number and print its factorial value.

3. Input values of base and index and calculate power.

4. Write a function to calculate number of days in given month of given year.

5. Write a function to check whether number is prime or not. Print result in main.

6. Write a program to print the day corresponding to given date.

7. Input a number and print its factorial value. Use Recursion.

8. Input values of base and index and calculate power. Use Recursion.

9. Print all factors of given number. Use Recursion.
Example:- If number is 24, output must be
24 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 3  

10. Write a program to print a given number of terms of fibbonacci series. Use Recursion. Fibbonacci series is given as
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...

11. Write a program to print binary equivalent of given integer. Use Recursion.
Example:- Binary equivalent of 25 is 11001.

12. Write a function to calculate sum & product of two integers. Print results in main.

13. Write a function to swap two numbers using third variables and without using third variable. Print swapped values in main.

14. Draw Pascal's Triangle.
			                	     1
                                                1          1
                                         1           2           1
                                    1          3           3          1
                               1         4           6          4           1

15. Write a function to determine whether a number is strong or not. Use the function to print all strong  number between 1 to 500. Example of strong number is 145 because 145 = factorial(1) + factorial(4) + factorial(5).

16. Write a function to find GCD of 2 numbers by Uclidean algorithm. Write one more function to calculate LCM of two numbers. Print both results in main.
	uclidean algorithm:- GCD of 123 & 36
		123 % 36 = 15	
		36 % 15 = 6
		15 % 6 = 3
		6 % 3 = 0
	Therfore GCD = 3

17. Write a function to calculate GCD of two numbers by Uclidean algorithm. Use Recursion.

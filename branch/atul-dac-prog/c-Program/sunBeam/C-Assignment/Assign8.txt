/*Strings*/

1. Input two strings from user and perform the operations on it using following library functions. Program must be menu driven.
	i. strlen
	ii. strcpy
	iii. strcat
	iv. strcmp
	v. strrev
	vi. strcmpi
	vii. strchr
	viii. strstr
	ix. strupr
	x. strlwr

2. Implement your own functions to simulate library functions given above.

3. Implement your own functions using pointers to simulate library functions given above.

4. Write a function to find a substring in the original string and replace it by another string given by user.
Prototype:- void findreplace(char *string, char *find, char *replace);
Example:- If user input is
string = This is Test time. 
find = Test
replace = Examination
Then output must be
This is Examination time.

5. Write a function to delete a given character from string without leaving any hole.

6. Write a program to display calender of a given month in given year.

7. Sort a given set of strings using any sort alogorithm. Use 2-d arrays.

8. Sort a given set of strings using any sort alogorithm. Don't consider case. Use array of pointers.

9. Input a string from user and output a design pattern.
Example:- If entered string.. ABCDEF
Ouput must be
ABCDEFFEDCBA
ABCDE  EDCBA
ABCD    DCBA
ABC      CBA
AB        BA
A          A

10. Write a function to determine whether given string is palindrome or not. Palindrome string is the string which remains unchanged after reversing it. example:- saras . Do not include "string.h"

11. Write a program to create acromatic string. Example :- Entered String :- Government of India
Acromatic string is :- GoI

12. Write a function to print a given number in words. Number will be in range of long. Make proper user of user defined and library functions.

13. Count number of words in a string. Also find words of highest and lowest lengths.

Point to Note for String Operations :

1] char str [] = "HELLO"  ===> "H E L L O \0"

2] char ch = 'H'          ===> H, Here H is a character, not a string, so not terminated with NULL character.

3] char str = "H"         ===> "H \0", Note here it is terminated with NULL character.


ASCII Code for String : 

a] A-Z ===> 65-91
b] a-z ===> 97-123

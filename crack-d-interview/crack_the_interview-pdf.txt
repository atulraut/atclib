Q] Can we do a Binary search on a linked list?
A] https://www.quora.com/Can-binary-search-algorithms-be-applied-on-sorted-linked-lists/answer/Vinay-Patil-3?share=0652cfb4&srid=OEEZ
No.
Reason : Binary search algorithm is based on the logic of reducing your input size by half in every step until your search succeeds or input  gets exhausted. Important point here is "the step to reduce input size should take constant time". In case of an array, it's always a simple comparison based on array indexes that takes O(1) time.
But in case of Linked list you don't have indexes to access items. To perform any operation on a list item, you first have to reach it by traversing all items before it. So to divide list by half you first have to reach middle of the list then perform a comparison. Getting to middle of list takes 
O(n/2)[you have to traverse half of the list items] and comparison takes O(1).
Total = O(n/2) + O(1) = O(n/2)
So the input reduction step does not take constant time. It depends on list size. hence violates the essential requirement of Binary search.

Q] Write a C program to return the nth node from the end of a linked list. New!
A] Check 9th routine - ~/dev/c/atclib/crack-d-interview/linklist/singly_void:
len = 4 [Total 4 node in list]
NthNode=3 [Find 3rd element from last]  
->[1]->[2]->[3]->[4]
  1    2    3    4
       | ANS  	
Trav = len-NthNode+1 = 4-3+1 = 1+1=2
i=1; i<len-NthNode+1

Q] How would you find out if one of the pointers in a linked list is corrupted or not? New!
A] Introduce a magic value in your node structures. Initialize it upon new node allocation. Before every access, check if the node structure that the pointer points to contains the valid magic. If the pointer points at an unreadable data block, your program will crash. For that, on Windows there's API VirtualQuery() - call that before reading, and make sure the pointer points at readable data.

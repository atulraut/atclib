Implementation of Brian Kernighanâ€™s Algorithm:
   1  Initialize count: = 0
   2  If integer n is not zero
      (a) Do bitwise & with (n-1) and assign the value back to n
          n = n&(n-1)
      (b) Increment count by 1
      (c) go to step 2
   3  Else return count

 Brian Kernighan's method goes through as many iterations as there are set bits. 
 So if we have a 32-bit word with only the high bit set, then it will only go once through the loop.
 if v = 5 - 4 2 1
            1 0 1 - 2 bits are set

    unsigned int v = 5; // count the number of bits set in v

    for (c = 0; v; c++) {
      v = v & (v - 1); // clear the least significant bit set
    }
    printf ("\n cnt v= %d c = %d \n", v, c);
